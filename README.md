### Hi there 👋

I'm Ken! 

💻 I've been working in various data roles since 2016. Currently I'm a Data Engineer working in the retail data space but in the past I've been a data scientist in the retail and fraud space. 

🎓 I received my MSCS from UMass Amherst in 2020. 

🧗‍♂️ In my free time I enjoy rock climbing!

My [full time work](https://github.com/kenmyers-8451) is private but I mostly work with Python, Spark, Databricks, Terraform, and Github Actions.

Check out some of my other recent personal projects:

- 🤖 [Viral Reddit Posts](https://github.com/ViralRedditPosts) - a project that predicts viral Reddit posts. Included is IaC written in Terraform to set up the project start to finish with AWS.
- 🐝 [Spelling Bee Trainer](https://github.com/kennethjmyers/SpellingBeeTrainer) - a [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/spelling-bee-trainer/cdgcncbhgjfcgmdkiklogjapkbfpbdjc?pli=1) that helps the user learn words they could not think of while playing the NYT Spelling Bee Game.
- 🐝 [Spelling Bee Solver](https://github.com/kennethjmyers/SpellingBeeSolver) - an app that efficiently solves the NYT Spelling Bee game and provides possible solutions.
- 🦋 [Bsky data project](https://github.com/kennethjmyers/bsky_data_project) - a TypeScript project that scrapes a users [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) posting data
  - 📈 [tremor-test-app](https://github.com/kennethjmyers/tremor-test-app) - a dashboard made with [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/) to render the collected Bluesky data (repo needs some polishing)
